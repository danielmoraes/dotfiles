# Gruvbox awesome theme by McSinyx

## A few side notes

* The backgrounds are pixel-based, for best result please resize them using a
  proper algorithim, e.g. in GIMP use *None* or *Linear* interpolation.

* Titlebar and wibox use some pixel arts, so please keep theme at the size of
  22px.

* I added some 22-pixel high arrows to the theme. You might wanna use them to
  rice your desktop in the *powerarrow* way.
